__Game plan (inspired by OG Pac-Man):__
* 10 players max
* General overview (see attached img)
  * On entry to the game, the players will spawn on one corner of the map.
  * ***The AIM*** of the game is to keep eating the 'pellets' which will randomly spawn on the map and avoid the ghosts.
    * 1 pellet = 1 score
    * score will drop to zero if the player collides with a ghost
  * Survive until timer runs out.
