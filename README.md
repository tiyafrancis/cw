* MMOG ver. of pac-man called PacRace

__Game plan (inspired by OG Pac-Man):__
* 10 players max
* General overview (see attached img)
  * On entry to the game, the players will spawn on one corner of the map.
  * ***The AIM*** of the game is to keep eating the 'pellets' which will randomly spawn on the map. Eat as many pellets as you can before the time is up.
    * 1 pellet = 1 score
    * score will drop to zero if the player collides with a ghost
  * Eat until timer runs out. Player with the highest score is the winner.
